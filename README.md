# pyshare

Python interface to work with SHARE data (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe)

<br>

## Installation

```

<br>

## Quick start

In order to read SHARE data, it requires you to have access to them, to download them locally (Stata version) and unzip them. By default it looks for the `data` directory.

```py
import pyshare as ps

df = ps.read_share_wave(9)
df.shape
#> (97365, 4462)
```
